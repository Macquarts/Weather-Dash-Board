# Weather-DashBoard

The Weather Dashboard uses a third-party API that allows developers to access their data and functionality when requested. This weather API allows us to view the current, present and future conditions for the city that has been chosen and adds the search to the history.

## Project Requirement

-  This project required us to create a dashboard with form inputs. When inputs such as city name were searched for, the search presented the current and  
   future weather conditions for that city and the city searched was added to the search history.
-  When viewing the current weather conditions for that city, the city name along with the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature,  
   humidity, wind speed and the UV index is presented.
-	 When viewing the UV index, the weatherboard presents it with a colour that indicates whether the conditions are favourable, moderate or severe.
-  When the future weather conditions for the city chosen is viewed, a 5-day forecast is displayed with the date, an icon representing the weather conditions,  
   temperature, wind speed and humidity is displayed.
-  When clicked on a city in the search history, it presents with the current and future conditions for that city.
