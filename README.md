# Weather-DashBoard


## About Weather-Dashboard
The Weather Dashboard uses a third-party API that allows developers to access their data and functionality when requested. 
This weather API allows us to view the current, present and future conditions for the city that has been chosen and adds the search to the history.


## Project Requirement
- This project required us to create a dashboard with form inputs. When inputs (such as city name) was searched for, the search will present with current and   future weather conditions for that city and that city would be added to the search history.

- When viewing the current weather conditions for that city, the city name along with the date, an icon repsenting the weather conditions,temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index is preseneted.

- When viewing the UV index, the weatherboard presents it with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe.

- When the future weather conditions for the city chosen is viewed,  a 5-day forcast is displayed with the date, an icon resprenting the weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity is displayed.

-When clicked on a city in the search history, it presents with the current and future conditions for that city.
